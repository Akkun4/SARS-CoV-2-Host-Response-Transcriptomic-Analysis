PROJECT OVERVIEW:
In this project, my goal was to investigate how our genes responded to SARS-CoV-2 infection over a 24-hour and 72-hour period. 
The focus was on identifying genes that significantly changed at these specific time points. 
By doing this, I aimed to uncover the molecular details of how our body's genetic machinery reacts to the virus. 
The entire analysis involved several steps, starting from processing raw sequencing data to pinpointing differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using a specialized tool called DESeq2.

Scientific Significance
Host Response Dynamics:
I wanted to understand how our gene activity changed during the early stages (24 hours) and later (72 hours) after exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. 
This time-specific approach allowed me to capture the evolving genetic signatures as our body responded to the virus.

Molecular Mechanisms Unveiled:
To get a clear picture, I meticulously processed raw sequencing data, aligned it to the human genome (GRCh38), and ensured its quality. 
Trimming steps were also performed to enhance accuracy. All these efforts were geared towards unraveling the molecular mechanisms driving our response to SARS-CoV-2.

Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs):
The core of my analysis involved identifying DEGs using the powerful DESeq2 framework. 
These were the genes that underwent significant changes in expression, providing insights into the regulatory processes triggered by SARS-CoV-2. 
Understanding these genes is crucial for comprehending how our body defends itself and adapts to the viral intrusion.
